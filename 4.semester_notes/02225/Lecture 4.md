A section of the timeline between two different instants is called a ***duration***
If two events occur at the same instant, then the two events are said to occur ***simultaneously***.

- **Temporal Order**: Sequence of events based on their occurrence in time.
- **Causal Order**: Sequence of events based on cause-and-effect relationships.
- **Delivery Order**: Sequence of events as delivered or observed in a distributed system, independent of temporal or causal relationships.

**Granularity of a Clock**: It is the smallest time interval that the clock can measure.
A **reference clock** is an idealized, highly precise clock used as a universal standard for time measurement.
An **absolute time-stamp** is the exact time recorded by the reference clock when an event occurs.
**Clock Drift** refers to the phenomenon where a clock gradually loses or gains time compared to a more accurate reference clock.
**Failure Modes of a Clock** refer to the ways in which a clock can malfunction or become unreliable. These failures can affect the accuracy, consistency, or functionality of the clock, leading to incorrect time measurements.
