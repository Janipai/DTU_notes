We can separate critical assets into three categories: software, hardware and network. And to mitigate the overall system-wide we have to improve everyday security practices such as:
- strong passwords
- software updates
- malware protections

From a network perceptive it is important to separate critical and non-critical components.
Likewise from a hardware perspective is it important to have backups in case of some components fails (radar)

Beside of that it is also important to training the crew members to handle cyber responses in case of other components fails, and to preventing malicious actors to come in their network. That could be to have some phishing campaigns 

It is also important to monitor and log system activities for early detection of suspicious behaviour. That could be to monitor failed logins and if the gps coordinate change significantly in few seconds.

After identifying the components, it was seen that most of them were depended on each other. And most of them shared the same vulnerabilities. Like
- weak authentication 
- outdated software
- unsegmented networks 

Beside of software, hardware and network threats, humans do also play an important role. They have to be aware and trained to preventing and handling incidents. 

Most of the systems are based on old methods and tools, and is not built for modern threats. That is why many components lack of basic cybersecurity protection.

lastly octave helped us identifying all the critical assets for components first, rather on all vulnerabilities which was resulting in prioritizing our risks.
