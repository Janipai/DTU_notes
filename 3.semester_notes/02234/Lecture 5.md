### Quantum computing changes cryptography
NIST vs TSL encryption

secureity against quantum attackers

Broken schemes due to quantum computing
block cipher is broken
- RSA
- Diffie-Hellman(ordinary and elliptic curve)
- (signatures)

great for ransomware

TLS became broken or insecure when talking about quantum computing

### how does a qc break crypto?

The period-finding problem?

### Solution: Post quantum cryptography
Lattice problems
Solving systems of multicariate polynomial equations

KEM: key encapsulation mechanism

pq-secure
