low interaction honeypot
- Low­Interaction honeypots are described as the subset of honeypots designed to emulate
only specific services or protocols
high interaction honeypot
- High­Interaction is the other subset of honeypots, boasting an increased level of sophisti­
cation and realism to lure and trap potential attackers. Unlike their low­interaction counter­
parts, high­interaction honeypots provide a full­fledged environment for attackers, often
using real operating systems, applications, and services [10].
