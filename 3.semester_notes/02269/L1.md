This activity
is modeled by transition register request. Each transition is represented by a square.
Transitions are connected through places that model possible states of the process.
Each place is represented by a circle. In a Petri net a transition is enabled, i.e., the
corresponding activity can occur, if all input places hold a token. Transition register
request has only one input place (start) and this place initially contains a token to
represent the request for compensation.
