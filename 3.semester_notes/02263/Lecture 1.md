formal the specification and verification activities:
1. formal specification  
2. formal specification and semi-formal verification  
3. formal specification and formal verification

A specification is a description of a product (either to be build or existing).

A specification is said to be formal if it is expressed in a formal notation or a formal specification language, i.e. a language that has a precise syntax (e.g. given by a BNF grammar) and for which every sentence in the language has a unique mathematical meaning

Each formal specification language has its own underlying mathematical logical  
framework consisting of a notion of (software) models, a notion of sentences  
(also called statements or formulas) that can be used to express properties  
about such models and a notion of what it means for a model to satisfy a  
sentence.

- **Semi-formal proofs**: Semi-formal5 proofs are written using a mixture of mathematical formulas and natural language
- **Formal proofs**: Formal proofs are not using natural language, but are expressed in a symbolic language (called a proof language) having a precise syntax
- **Model checking**: x

- safety properties that express that a system never reaches a bad state (e.g. where two trains collide),  
- lifeness/progress properties that express that a system will eventually reach a desired state (e.g. one in which a signal shows a go aspect)
