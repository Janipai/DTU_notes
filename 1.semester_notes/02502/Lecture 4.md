Morphology

- hit operation
    - just one
- fit opertion
    - all of them

D**ilation** based on the hit operation

- The object becomes bigger and holes are filled

E**rosion** based on the fit opertion

- to wear down (t√¶re/gnave)

comound operations

- combination between dilation and erosion
    
- Opening
    
    - remove small objects but keep original size
    - erosion + dilation
- Closing
    
    - fill holes but keep original size
    - dilation + erosion
