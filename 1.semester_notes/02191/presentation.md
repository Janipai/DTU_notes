What is steganography?
Steganography is a technique to hide data within an ordinary and nonsecret file or message to avoid detection

The purpose
so the purpose is (as I said before) to avoid detection by concealing information within another message. This could be a message that says meet me at this point or some data of password. In the old days they did it in physical objects

The history
Steganography as a technique is **an ancient practice that has taken many forms and shapes**. 
It has Seen various means to hide intended secret messages. 
Some of the physical objects that has been modified was writing on the wax tablets and stomachs of rabbits.

%The different between encryption and steganography
Some of the key differences between encryption and steganography is that
Steganography refers to the practice of concealing a message (without any traceability).
Therefore only the person who is expecting a message would know there would be a hidden message.

While cryptography, refers to the art of converting a plaintext (message) into an unreadable format

when is it normally used
so typically it is used for digital watermarking. By having this technique sources can track, verify or identify an image.

so it is can not only used for malicious purposes

The different types of steganography is text, image, audio and pdf
and have different techniques and tools to hide data in them.

Text
For text it is about embedding information by modifying spaces, styling or sizes of the text

Image
and when having images is about hiding the information by modifying the least significant bits without significantly affecting the visual appearance, or by slightly changing the values of color channels (RGB)

Audio
There is various techniques to hide information in audio, one of them is spread spectrum technique that spread the hidden informaion across a broad range of frequencies. This makes the modifications harder to detect, as they are distributed across the entire frequency spectrum.

PDF
and for pdf it is by altering metadata you can change the author, name or creation data to your hidden message or just embedding data in some of the layers in a PDF document

We will focus on steganography in documents and show a demo later on
