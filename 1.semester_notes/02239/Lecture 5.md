Protocol Security II
Assumptions and goals

The assumptions a passiv or active attack can accure

The goal is to have a secure connection though the evil cloud

- they have to know each other before they share their secrets
- strong authentication is when the request and witness match and send two intenses (injectiv agreement) and we count the requests and witnesses

weak authentication: attack is when the request doesn’t have a matching witness

Channels

bullet at the end of the arrow means that it is a confidential channel

reverse dot arroe is when we know the authenticator is who they say they are

Diffie-Hellman creates a secure channel from authentic channels

TLS

- handshake
- transport

we want to gen two keys

key certificate issued for B by a trusted thord party s

højre side er agent

venstre side er role

B=b

a secure channel with whoever A is

[A]\cdot →\cdot B:M
