A network system can be as large as the internet and as small as two computers

snake-oil cryptography/security
cold boot attacks?

why security fails:
- humans: this is the biggest problem- but hard to solve
- math/crypto/technology evolves

types of attackers:
- cyber-criminals (wants to make money)
- governments
- organized crime groups
- cyber-terrorists
- hackers
	- hired
	- curious folks
	- professionals
	- script kiddies
- Hacktivists

security is an inconvenience
- it cost money and lowers the performance of the system

absolute security is impossible (and often unaffordable)

Security modelling
- CIA model
- Security Design Principles
	- Least privilege 
		- A subject should have only the necessary rights and not more 
	- Separation of privilege 
		- A process should be constructed in parts with separate access rights 
	- Fail-safe default 
		- Deny access by default and only grant access with explicit permission 
	- Economy of mechanism 
		- Keep it simple, complexity creates more opportunities for things to go wrong 
	- Open design (see also Kerckhoffs’ principle) 
		- Protection should not rely on secrecy of the protection mechanism itself 
	- Phycological acceptability
		- Impact to users should be minimal

Mirai er malware, der gør netværksenheder, der kører Linux, til fjernstyrede bots, der kan bruges som en del af et botnet i store netværksangreb.

Attacker model
- blocking
- intercepting - Reading or listening to the message
- modyfing
- fabricating - an authentic-looking message
