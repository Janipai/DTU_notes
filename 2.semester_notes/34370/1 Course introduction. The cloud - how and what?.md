Key questions:
- What is ”the Cloud”?  
- What are its components? Physical vs non-physical?  
- Which are the different Cloud deployment models?  
- What about Cloud service models?  
- What is a virtual network?

legally policy that says data can not be stored anywhere. Like DTU can only store data in EU and not in a AWS or Googles cloud service in the US. 

local servers in a network, can also have a enterprise DC, so companies across department can access data.

cloud DC benefits with scaling if it is run by a third party


| Enterprise computing | Cloud computing |
| --- | --- |
| - Use of IT within organization to support  <br>business processes and goals  <br>– Organization owns/maintains IT-infra-  <br>structure  <br>– Time-consuming to scale up/down  <br>– Significant CAPEX up-front and OPEX  <br>– Control over sensitive data | Delivering on-demand computing  <br>services over the internet  <br>– External provider owns/maintains IT-  <br>infrastructure  <br>– Fast to scale up/down based on  <br>current demand  <br>– Pay-as-you-go model  (you only pays for what you use, compared to if you run your own servers. Then you have to pay for the hole server)<br>– May be difficult to know where  <br>sensitive data is stored/processed |

trafic an capacity

Accounting: tracking what you do
We need isolation if we are installing a public cloud


community cloud
the idea is it is kinda a private cloud for customer that have similiar requriments

hybrid cloud
organization combining public and private clouding
computing requirement, that is host inhouse.

to scale it takes more servers, that takes time and are expensive
security: configuration give higher errors?

CaaS: you have to deliver some context for the customer?
DaaS: you have a remote desktop


Fog computing is when you have distributed computering resources close to you, so it will be faster

cloud carrier is basically a cloud ??


isolate, so it doesnt broadcast to different devices.
each users have their own private network?

for a big datacenter has problems:
we use qinq to have to tags, to seperate the different customer
