Virtualizing network functions (vNFs) - What? Why? How?  
Why:
make every service to run on top of IP
by providing new software, you can offer you customer a service that cant be offered anywhere else

What:
Processing data?
one box to another do different things

run some software instead of have some physical elements
vNF is a piece of software that can run at a datacenter on a  generel hardware
when a services is not needed, the hardware space can be used to something else instead of throw a physical machine out.

a network slice is a set of network services that may or may not be virtualized

TDC have 4 dc in denmark for reliability and so on. They want to run it inhouse

How:
software is not tied to any hardware
If we sendt data between datacenters it gives latency

left side is the traditional way of doing things
we are limited to it can only do one purpose it is supposed to do. (not generel/scalable)
it is expensive to build a physical network

the right side is more generel, cause it is not custom made to one purpose
