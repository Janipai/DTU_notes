### Security definitions and the OTP
Symmetric key encryption (SKE)

k is chosen from the key space K
$$
k \in K
$$
output a fix element (ortogonal symbolet)

correctness is when

no matter if the attacker sees the algorithms, they wont be able to see the plaintext or the key
### proving the OTP secure


### IND-CPA
the circle notation is "talking to"
